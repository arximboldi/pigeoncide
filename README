Pidgeoncide - README
--------------------

Pidgeoncide is a funny game where you control an ill-minded child
whose imaginary friend tells him to kill all the pidgeons in the
world.

To be able to Pidgeoncide you should have the Panda3D engine properly
installed. Once you meet all the requirements you can just execute:

    ./pidgeoncide
